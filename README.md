## Overview and Origin

**Name of Company:** OpenAI

**Incorporation Date:** December 2015

**Founders:**
- **Elon Musk:** *Tech entrepreneur, co-founder of Tesla and SpaceX.*
- **Sam Altman:** *Former president of Y Combinator, an influential startup accelerator.*
- **Greg Brockman:** *Former CTO of Stripe, a major online payments company.*
- **Ilya Sutskever:** *AI researcher and former Google Brain team member.*
- **Wojciech Zaremba:** *AI researcher with expertise in robotics and machine learning.*
- **John Schulman:** *Research scientist with a focus on reinforcement learning.*


**Project Origin:**
The idea for OpenAI Five emerged from OpenAI’s broader mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. Dota 2 was chosen due to its complexity, requiring long-term strategic planning, teamwork, and adaptability, which made it an ideal testbed for pushing the limits of reinforcement learning.

> "One AI milestone is to exceed human capabilities in a complex video game like StarCraft or Dota. Relative to previous AI milestones like Chess or Go, complex video games start to capture the messiness and continuous nature of the real world. The hope is that systems which solve complex video games will be highly general, with applications outside of games."
> – *[OpenAI Five: The Journey](https://openai.com/blog/openai-five/)*


**Funding:**
OpenAI initially operated as a non-profit with $1 billion in committed funding from its founders and investors. In 2019, OpenAI transitioned to a capped-profit model and secured an additional $1 billion investment from Microsoft, signaling a shift towards more commercially viable projects.

## Business Activities

**Problem Solved:**
OpenAI Five sought to demonstrate that AI could excel in environments with high uncertainty and complexity, such as Dota 2, where the sheer number of possible game states and required coordination among team members far exceeds that of traditional games like chess or Go.
> "The game of Dota 2 presents novel challenges for AI systems such as long time horizons, imperfect information, and complex, continuous state-action spaces, all challenges which will become increasingly central to more capable AI systems."  
> – *[Dota 2 with Large Scale Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06680)*

**Intended Customers:**
While the project was primarily a research endeavor, it captured the attention of AI researchers, gaming companies, and the general public. The gaming industry, in particular, benefited from the demonstration of AI's potential to enhance game development and player experience.

**Unique Solution:**
Unlike traditional game AI that relies on scripted behaviors, OpenAI Five utilized deep reinforcement learning, allowing the AI to learn optimal strategies through self-play. The distributed training process, running on thousands of GPUs, enabled OpenAI Five to train faster and more effectively than any previous AI.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO):** A reinforcement learning algorithm developed by OpenAI to balance exploration and exploitation during training. Unlike standard policy gradient methods, PPO allows for multiple epochs of minibatch updates, striking a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.

> We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a “surrogate” objective function using stochastic gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.

- **Distributed Training:** Leveraging vast computational resources to parallelize training across thousands of instances, dramatically speeding up the learning process.
- **Self-Play:** A technique where the AI continually plays against itself, learning from its mistakes and improving over time without human intervention.


## Landscape

**Field:** AI in Gaming and Reinforcement Learning

**Trends and Innovations:**
Over the past decade, AI in gaming has shifted from rule-based systems to more adaptive, learning-based approaches. Reinforcement learning has emerged as a key technique, with applications extending beyond gaming into fields like robotics, finance, and autonomous systems. Notable innovations include DeepMind's AlphaGo, which conquered the ancient game of Go, and OpenAI Five, which tackled the highly dynamic environment of Dota 2.
> "High-dimensional, continuous action space. In Dota, each hero can take dozens of actions, and many actions target either another unit or a position on the ground. We discretize the space into 170,000 possible actions per hero (not all valid each tick, such as using a spell on cooldown); not counting the continuous parts, there are an average of ~1,000 valid actions each tick. The average number of actions in chess is 35; in Go, 250."

**Competitors:**

- **DeepMind:** Known for AlphaGo and AlphaStar, which focused on real-time strategy games like StarCraft II.

> – *"AlphaStar’s behaviour is generated by a deep neural network that receives input data from the raw game interface (a list of units and their properties), and outputs a sequence of instructions that constitute an action within the game. More specifically, the neural network architecture applies a transformer torso to the units (similar to relational deep reinforcement learning), combined with a deep LSTM core, an auto-regressive policy head with a pointer network, and a centralised value baseline. We believe that this advanced model will help with many other challenges in machine learning research that involve long-term sequence modelling and large output spaces such as translation, language modelling and visual representations."*  
> – *[DeepMind’s AlphaStar and Its Impact](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-the-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii)*

- **Google Brain:** A leader in AI research, particularly in deep learning and natural language processing.

- **IBM Watson:** Pioneered AI applications in healthcare and business, though less focused on gaming.

OpenAI Five achieved global recognition when it defeated top-tier professional Dota 2 teams, showcasing the practical potential of AI in complex, real-time environments. This success solidified OpenAI's reputation as a leader in AI research and attracted further investment and partnerships, particularly with Microsoft.
> "By defeating the Dota 2 world champion (Team OG), OpenAI Five demonstrates that self-play reinforcement learning can achieve superhuman performance on a difficult task."  
> – *[Dota 2 with Large Scale Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06680)*

**Core Metrics:**
- **Win Rate:** OpenAI Five achieved an impressive win rate against both amateur and professional human players, with its most notable victory being against the reigning Dota 2 world champions, OG.
- **Scalability:** The ability to scale training across massive computational resources demonstrated the feasibility of training sophisticated AI systems within a reasonable timeframe.
- **Public Engagement:** The project generated significant media coverage and public interest, furthering discussions on AI capabilities and ethics.

**Performance Relative to Competitors:**
Compared to competitors like DeepMind's AlphaStar, OpenAI Five excelled in a more complex, team-based environment, setting a new standard for what AI could achieve in gaming. However, OpenAI Five's specialization in Dota 2 also highlighted the challenges of generalizing AI skills across different types of games and tasks.

## Recommendations

**Implement Complex Reward Structures in AI Training**  
To ensure smooth and effective learning curves in AI models, OpenAI and similar companies should implement complex reward structures that reward a variety of intermediate actions rather than relying solely on binary win/lose rewards. Research has shown that binary rewards can lead to slower learning and plateauing, whereas shaped rewards encourage consistent progress and adaptation.

> "Binary rewards can give good performance. Our 1v1 model had a shaped reward, including rewards for last hits, kills, and the like. We ran an experiment where we only rewarded the agent for winning or losing, and it trained an order of magnitude slower and somewhat plateaued in the middle, in contrast to the smooth learning curves we usually see."  
> – *[OpenAI Five: The Journey](https://openai.com/blog/openai-five/)*

**Allocate Sufficient Computational Resources for Optimal AI Training**  
Achieving superhuman performance in complex environments requires not only sophisticated reward structures but also substantial computational power. OpenAI's experience shows that even with significant resources, the choice of reward structure can limit performance. To reach higher levels of AI capability, companies must ensure they have the necessary computational infrastructure.

> "The experiment ran on 4,500 cores and 16 k80 GPUs, training to the level of semi-pros (70 TrueSkill) rather than 90 TrueSkill of our best 1v1 bot."  
> – *[OpenAI Five: The Journey](https://openai.com/blog/openai-five/)*

By following these recommendations, OpenAI can continue to push the boundaries of AI performance, ensuring that their models not only learn efficiently but also achieve and maintain superhuman capabilities in increasingly complex environments.

**Suggested Products/Services:**
OpenAI could expand its reinforcement learning technology to other strategic, multi-agent environments beyond gaming. For example, applying these techniques to autonomous robotics, financial markets, or even real-time logistics could yield significant commercial benefits.

**Benefits:**
Expanding into these areas would diversify OpenAI’s portfolio and open new revenue streams. Moreover, success in these domains would further establish OpenAI as a leader in applying AI to real-world challenges.

**Technologies:**
- **Transfer Learning:** To adapt the knowledge gained from Dota 2 to other domains, OpenAI could leverage transfer learning techniques. This approach would allow AI systems to quickly and efficiently apply their learned strategies to new environments, reducing the need for extensive retraining. For example, just as IBM Watson utilizes a combination of natural language processing and machine learning to draw insights from large datasets, similar techniques could be applied to adapt AI strategies learned in one context (such as gaming) to another (such as healthcare or finance).

> "Described on the company’s website as 'a technology platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts of unstructured data,' it was this combination of intelligence that allowed [IBM Watson] to understand and answer the Jeopardy! questions correctly."  
> – *[5 Ways IBM Watson Is Changing Health Care](https://www.medicaldaily.com/5-ways-ibm-watson-changing-health-care-diagnosing-disease-treating-it-364394)*

By utilizing transfer learning, OpenAI can similarly adapt AI techniques developed in the gaming sector to tackle challenges in other domains, thereby expanding the impact of its technology.

- **Hybrid Systems:** Combining reinforcement learning with symbolic AI or expert systems could enhance performance in tasks requiring both strategy and domain-specific knowledge.

**Appropriateness:**  
These technologies are well-suited to the challenges of real-world applications, where AI must not only learn from scratch but also adapt to existing knowledge and systems. However, the effectiveness of implementing such advanced AI techniques depends not only on technological readiness but also on the stability and coherence of the organization's strategic direction. Given the ongoing disputes between key figures such as Elon Musk and Sam Altman, there is an underlying risk that leadership conflicts could disrupt the cohesive decision-making necessary for long-term AI development.

> "At the heart of Musk's lawsuit are allegations that OpenAI has strayed from its founding principles, which emphasized open-source development and ethical considerations in AI advancement. The lawsuit argues that the company's current focus on profit, particularly through its close partnership with Microsoft, represents a departure from these initial goals. This partnership is under intense scrutiny, with Musk alleging that it compromises OpenAI's independence and contradicts its original open-source ethos. Such internal and external pressures could challenge the broader trajectory of AI development at OpenAI, particularly concerning the commercialization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)."

To navigate these challenges, it is crucial for OpenAI to maintain strong internal decision-making processes that can ensure continuity in its research and development efforts. Additionally, fostering transparent communication within the organization and with external stakeholders can help mitigate uncertainties, ensuring that the company remains focused on its mission despite potential leadership dynamics. By addressing these organizational aspects, OpenAI can better position itself to fully realize the potential of transfer learning and hybrid systems in advancing AI applications across diverse domains.
