# OpenAI Five: Mastering Complex Multi-Agent Environments Through Reinforcement Learning

## Overview and Origin

**Name of Company:** OpenAI

**Incorporation Date:** December 2015

**Founders:**
- Elon Musk: Tech entrepreneur, co-founder of Tesla and SpaceX.
- Sam Altman: Former president of Y Combinator, an influential startup accelerator.
- Greg Brockman: Former CTO of Stripe, a major online payments company.
- Ilya Sutskever: AI researcher and former Google Brain team member.
- Wojciech Zaremba: AI researcher with expertise in robotics and machine learning.
- John Schulman: Research scientist with a focus on reinforcement learning.

**Project Origin:**
The idea for OpenAI Five emerged from OpenAI’s broader mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. Dota 2 was chosen due to its complexity, requiring long-term strategic planning, teamwork, and adaptability, which made it an ideal testbed for pushing the limits of reinforcement learning.

**Funding:**
OpenAI initially operated as a non-profit with $1 billion in committed funding from its founders and investors. In 2019, OpenAI transitioned to a capped-profit model and secured an additional $1 billion investment from Microsoft, signaling a shift towards more commercially viable projects.

## Business Activities

**Problem Solved:**
OpenAI Five sought to demonstrate that AI could excel in environments with high uncertainty and complexity, such as Dota 2, where the sheer number of possible game states and required coordination among team members far exceeds that of traditional games like chess or Go.

**Intended Customers:**
While the project was primarily a research endeavor, it captured the attention of AI researchers, gaming companies, and the general public. The gaming industry, in particular, benefited from the demonstration of AI's potential to enhance game development and player experience.

**Unique Solution:**
Unlike traditional game AI that relies on scripted behaviors, OpenAI Five utilized deep reinforcement learning, allowing the AI to learn optimal strategies through self-play. The distributed training process, running on thousands of GPUs, enabled OpenAI Five to train faster and more effectively than any previous AI.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO):** A reinforcement learning algorithm developed by OpenAI to balance exploration and exploitation during training.
- **Distributed Training:** Leveraging vast computational resources to parallelize training across thousands of instances, dramatically speeding up the learning process.
- **Self-Play:** A technique where the AI continually plays against itself, learning from its mistakes and improving over time without human intervention.

## Landscape

**Field:** AI in Gaming and Reinforcement Learning

**Trends and Innovations:**
Over the past decade, AI in gaming has shifted from rule-based systems to more adaptive, learning-based approaches. Reinforcement learning has emerged as a key technique, with applications extending beyond gaming into fields like robotics, finance, and autonomous systems. Notable innovations include DeepMind's AlphaGo, which conquered the ancient game of Go, and OpenAI Five, which tackled the highly dynamic environment of Dota 2.

**Competitors:**
- **DeepMind:** Known for AlphaGo and AlphaStar, which focused on real-time strategy games like StarCraft II.
- **Google Brain:** A leader in AI research, particularly in deep learning and natural language processing.
- **IBM Watson:** Pioneered AI applications in healthcare and business, though less focused on gaming.

## Results

**Business Impact:**
OpenAI Five achieved global recognition when it defeated top-tier professional Dota 2 teams, showcasing the practical potential of AI in complex, real-time environments. This success solidified OpenAI's reputation as a leader in AI research and attracted further investment and partnerships, particularly with Microsoft.

**Core Metrics:**
- **Win Rate:** OpenAI Five achieved an impressive win rate against both amateur and professional human players, with its most notable victory being against the reigning Dota 2 world champions, OG.
- **Scalability:** The ability to scale training across massive computational resources demonstrated the feasibility of training sophisticated AI systems within a reasonable timeframe.
- **Public Engagement:** The project generated significant media coverage and public interest, furthering discussions on AI capabilities and ethics.

**Performance Relative to Competitors:**
Compared to competitors like DeepMind's AlphaStar, OpenAI Five excelled in a more complex, team-based environment, setting a new standard for what AI could achieve in gaming. However, OpenAI Five's specialization in Dota 2 also highlighted the challenges of generalizing AI skills across different types of games and tasks.

## Recommendations

**Suggested Products/Services:**
OpenAI could expand its reinforcement learning technology to other strategic, multi-agent environments beyond gaming. For example, applying these techniques to autonomous robotics, financial markets, or even real-time logistics could yield significant commercial benefits.

**Benefits:**
Expanding into these areas would diversify OpenAI’s portfolio and open new revenue streams. Moreover, success in these domains would further establish OpenAI as a leader in applying AI to real-world challenges.

**Technologies:**
- **Transfer Learning:** To adapt the knowledge gained from Dota 2 to other domains, OpenAI could leverage transfer learning techniques.
- **Hybrid Systems:** Combining reinforcement learning with symbolic AI or expert systems could enhance performance in tasks requiring both strategy and domain-specific knowledge.

**Appropriateness:**
These technologies are well-suited to the challenges of real-world applications, where AI must not only learn from scratch but also adapt to existing knowledge and systems.
